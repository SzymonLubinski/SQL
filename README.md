# SQL Database

# Technologies
To create this website I used:
- Oracle sql developer
- SQL
- PL/SQL

# Description
The database was created to store the latest data on tourists spending time in europe.
In the database I have included:
- Constrains
- Program (data updating)
- Scheduler
- Instructions to use the SQL Loader

# Future
In the future, I'm going to create a python program that will download data from EUROSTAT and transfer it to the database.
